# Health

Health is a web application to support achieving health according to the WHO definition

> A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not
> merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

The application uses the the _*in5 model*_ model as described in a number of papers and articles that can be found
in the MARCH-APRIL edition of the _ACM_ publication [_Interactions_](https://interactions.acm.org/archive/toc/march-april-2020).
